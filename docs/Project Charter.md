| **Project Title:** Chat protocol  |
| --- |
| **Start Date:** 25/10/2019 | **End Date:** 6 months after the start date |
| **Project Manager:** Er Raqioui Sabrina |
| **Project Sponsor:** Sette Antonio |
| **Customer:** Students of G.Marconi |
| **Users:** Students of 5EI |
| Expectations: Team: have a client-side application that can interact with a chat message exchange server. |
| Purpose:Allow students and teachers to use an in-house messaging app for the exchange of information related to the school or external activities.  |
| **Goals and Objectives** :Objectives: the general objective is to provide an alternative way to exchange information.It is expected:     • an interface developed with JFrame that allows access to the user;     • simple and intuitive operation.  |
| **Schedule Information (Major milestones and deliverables)**:25/10/2019 -  Chat project introduction
08/10/2019 -  Subdivisions of tasks within the group and client initialization
15/11/2019 -  Finishing developing graphic part

| Project priorities and degrees of freedom: **Dates are not flexible without the teacher&#39;s prior authorization. The budget is not present. Roles can be changed based on the workloads of individual team members. Even if the roles are not expected to change during the project based on needs.**   |
| **Approach:** iterative and incremental planning. Feedback will be used from one iteration to the next to improve its performance. The first iteration will focus on the basic functionality of the app. Subsequent iterations will be based on its improvement |
| **Constraints** : Constraints: the teacher&#39;s approval is required for the application. We are proceeding with the project while pursuing this consensus with the understanding that we may not get it. If consent is denied, the team will create an incomplete or non-functioning application. |
| **Assumptions** : The terminals for the use of the chat are available and work when we need them. |
| **Success Criteria** : The project will be considered a success if the team will deliver an operational prototype at the end of the semester able to interact with the server for the exchange of packages necessary for communication between users. |
| **Scope** : The application is required to provide a simple interface for sending messages.As mentioned in the objectives section above, the delivered product should demonstrate the ability to provide proper communication end-to-end and broadcast users. |
| **Risks and obstacles to success** :  Risks and obstacles to success: the programming staff has little experience in developing an application using Java.Furthermore, you are not familiar with interfacing and using JFrame. We assume that they can become familiar with the environment and programming technologies during the early stages of the project. This lack of direct experience also makes it difficult to estimate the programming effort accurately.One or two defects that are difficult to find could easily extend the test phase beyond the project&#39;s expected end date. |

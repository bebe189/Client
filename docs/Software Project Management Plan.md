#### 1 Overview

##### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

Allow students and teachers to use an in-house messaging app for the exchange of
information related to the school or external activities.

The application is required to provide a simple interface for sending messages.
As mentioned in the objectives section above, the delivered product should
demonstrate the ability to provide proper communication end-to-end and broadcast
users.


```
Version 1.
```
##### 1.2 Goals and Objectives

Objectives: the general objective is to provide an alternative way to exchange
information.
It is expected:

- an interface developed with JFrame that allows access to the user;
- simple and intuitive operation.
- simple connection to other chat members

##### 1.4 Assumptions and Constraints

###### 1.4.1 Assumptions

1. The client should connect to the server.
2. The client should interact with the server to exchange messages in a public and
    private chat .Interfacing the app with a proxy server and third-party website is
    feasible.
3. The client should have a graphical interface

###### 1.4.2 Constraints

Constraints:

1. Use TCP protocol.
2. Client must connect with every TCP server.
3. Generate the packages wanted by the server.

##### 2.3 Technical Process

An iterative and incremental development process is planned. Feedback will be used
from each iteration to improve the next. The first iteration will focus on basic
functionality of the application. Subsequent iterations will build upon that and
incorporate more features as time allows.

##### 2.4 Tools

```
● Programming & Markup Languages – Java, XML
● Operating System – Windows 8.1/
● Version Control – all work products will be stored in an SVN repository
● Development Tools – Netbeans
● Presentation – Google Presentation
```

```
Version 1.
```
#### 3 Control Plan

##### 3.1 Monitoring and Control

The following list of dates includes formal reviews outside of the Communication Plan.
Milestones are included to reference where the project is scheduled to stand as these
reviews occur:

##### Date Review / Milestone

```
10/11/2019 Milestone: Technical Prototype Complete
17/11/2019 5-Minute Status Report
18/11/2019 Manager's Briefing
26/11/2019 Milestone: Iteration #1 Complete
11/12/2019 Milestone: Test Report Complete
13/12/2019 Inspection
15/12/2019 Milestone: Iteration #2 Complete
18/12/2019 Milestone: Product Released
21/12/2019 Final Presentations
```
##### 3.2 Configuration Management Plan

The following procedure is to be used when making changes to all baselined work
products:

1. All project work products will be stored in a centralized SVN repository running
    on a central server (GitHub).
2. All baselined documents will have a Document Control section with a change
    history to track initialization and subsequent changes.
3. All project work products (documents, source code, test cases, program data,
    test data, etc) will be stored in the SVN repository but not all will be under
    change control (subject to formal change control procedures.) Only the system
    requirements, project plan and source code will be baselined and under
    configuration control.
4. Items that are subject to change control will be considered baselined after a
    group review at the end of the initial document creation.
5. The change control procedure once a product is baselined is:
    (1) anyone wanting to make a change to a baselined item sends a message to
       the rest of the team describing the change, reason for the change.


```
Version 1.
```
(2) if no one responds to the group within 2 hours with a reason for why the
change request shouldn't be permitted, it will be considered accepted
and the person proposing the change may proceed with the change.
(3)if anyone does object to the change, the reason for objecting will be
discussed at a meeting on TeamSpeak or Discord where everyone is
invited to attend and voice their opinion. At the end of the meeting a
democratic vote will be held to decide whether or not the change should
be allowed.
(4)if a change takes place, the initiator must collaborate with the project
manager to update the schedule

#### 4 Supporting Process Plans

##### 4.1 Risk Management Plan

###### Rank Risk Probability

###### of Loss

###### Size of

###### Loss

###### Risk

###### Exposure

###### Response

```
1 Schedule / time
line delivery
```
```
Likely Major High Mitigate: Stick to the
schedule.
2 ManageMyID
website changes
HTML layout
```
```
Likely Moderate Moderate Avoid: Breaking the
parsing engine out into a
separately hosted server
allows for fixes to occur in
one place, instantly for all
users, and with minimal
intrusion.
3 Learning curve
for new tools and
technologies
longer than
expected
```
```
Unlikely Moderate Moderate Buy Information: Begin
working on a basic
prototype early to test
out fundamental
programming concepts &
knowledge
4 Data feed not
available from
ManageMyID
website
```
```
Unlikely Minor Low Avoid: Instead of using a
feed from ManageMyID,
depend upon logging into
the site, and pull relevant
information from HTML
fields.
```
##### 4.2 Test Plan

The test plan defines the items that will be tested, methods for testing.

##### 4.3 Product Acceptance Plan

At the conclusion of each iteration, the prototype created will tested to ensure it meets
the requirements of that iteration. An environment such as the iPhone simulator may
be used to test functionality in lieu of the app being loaded on an actual smartphone.

For the final iteration, product acceptance testing will ensure that the prototype
functions as expected with a user's data.
